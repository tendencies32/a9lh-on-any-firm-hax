# a9lh-on-any-firm-hax
not much to it, install a9lh using aurorawright's safea9lhinstaller method on 1.0-11.17
i'm not writing most of this from scratch cos im lazy lol, credits go out to Plailect for making the original guide, QuantumCat1 for making this archive easily accessible, and the numerous amount of other people who developed the tools used here
WARNING: NEVER do this without NTRBoot, this may (shouldn't, but can't be too careful) result in a brick, never do this with b9s installed, and on n3ds i STRONGLY discourage you not to do this, closing the lid will fry your 3ds if you do.
Check the wiki page for the actual guide
